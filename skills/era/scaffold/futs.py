# Vendored VERBATIM from google-research/era, implementation/futs.py
#   repo:   https://github.com/google-research/era
#   commit: eb56676ce0a9b22b0c357c218de09ac61e94fc4b  (branch main)
#   fetched: 2026-06-17
# This is the FROZEN neutral judge. Do NOT edit it during a search — editing
# the engine invalidates all node scores and cross-run comparison. Concurrency
# and node-logging live in the separate, clearly-labeled `futs_batched.py`
# extension, which reuses the primitives below so the selection math cannot drift.
